its been round since the beginning
the idea
just scrambled
it had to bootstrap its environment and ultimate being by itself from itself
life is order from chaos

life is an ongoing scultpure of order from chaos
a
any bit o life I talk to about their role in everything wants to distance itself from everything
because everything seems like an unconscious hellhole when it is in face the moment it is actually perceiving
the landscape we fashion
like downloading a whole bunch of some music instead of streaming it constantly
its about survival
of those higher life forms that we call music, culture

from the moment you are perceiving you can work towards a better moment
or more better moments in a general fashion
like a tribal culture or the thoughts of an artist collaborating with themselves

because we are all ourselves
we are linked by the space we are made of
and instead of always diverging into different windows we can converge on some real things to do
that's where the concept of real comes from
now it's confusion is part of the fear factory of our modern media, who keep people lost

I think the old phobic trust building would be a good HQ for Generation Zero
the concrete phallus of Constable street pointing straight to the empty generation
the ones waiting to get it back

they are everyone, but they may not know it
consciousness is knowing

we all wander around with a dazzling viewport full of unconscious garbage
art is a proof of consciousness, or it can be

we have the chance to change things in this state of being actually connected to the spectacle

religion was used in the place of good enough consciousness, since it satisfies enough basic facts of the human experience

but what is good enough consciousness?
saving the planet

it's in the name, plan it.

there are a trove of pleasures available to you in this tiny window of opportunity known as now

it's only a possibility what you're likely to get up to
based on the state of the cosmos around you

the oil monster or something has shocked the consciousness into action
good

we'll keep it up
we'll feed it
feed ourselves the future we want

all the newspaper is trying to save you from is unconsciousness
news appeals to the spectacle seeker in a way that is harmful to consciousness

its about choosing what to make of it
some say we could do better
does anyone disagree with that?
the tools we were waiting for are here

philosophical language for relating everything to
it's around
it can converge

the truth is plenty

downtime mascots as a symptom of sudden convergence on unconsciousness

even the word consciousness seems to imply a grasping, oscillating and leveling out

our heart and soul disappeared indoors in front of the media
just when we got the tools to make change we lost our minds
not that it isn't good to lose your mind
when you're vivid about that kind of thing you can benefit a lot more from the path it's inevitably going to take
rock and roll is about being on a rock but also rolling with the moment you have your hands on
it's about a feeling
not just whispering divergent crap but yelling whatever approaches truth
becuase we make the truth

instead of filling you with flaws the media should be enabling human potential
potential for enjoying music and colour
without navigating a crazy ineffective interface
computers are the infinity machines
they provide everything we need they just need the bits they host to be one coherent piece of information so our abilities can scale with the power we have just around the corner from us

I look at the world's best pole dancer in a window
with trickles and kaka sounds I am aroused
the promise of a female soon I vaguely recall from some kind of announcer
the girl at the 7am end of my all night consciousness bender blumps into being
demanding my shame for Tsunami warnings in Chile

this gives homeowners the impression their household is massively contaminated
I mind the unconsciousness drone volume

rules must be made for stopping families of players betting on matches
brids eh

wish the night was easier to manage
to intuit potential forms in the creative flow
and end up in beautifull orchestrated dream

we need to diversify the kinds of text out there
get away from the monolithic derelict inducing

pushing the search into blokedom we went out into space in search of stuff we could find right here on earth
found strange abstractions of quantum decoration we left behind ourselves
what can we get out of it
the secret to buffetdom?
