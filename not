its been round since the beginning
the idea
with distortion built in
it had to bootstrap its environment and ultimate being by itself from itself
life is order from chaos

life is an ongoing scultpure of order from chaos
a
any bit o life I talk to about their role in everything wants to distance itself from everything
because everything seems like an unconscious hellhole when it is in face the moment it is actually perceiving
the landscape we fashion
like downloading a whole bunch of some music instead of streaming it constantly
its about survival
of those higher life forms that we call music, culture

from the moment you are perceiving you can work towards a better moment
or more better moments in a general fashion
like a tribal culture or the thoughts of an artist collaborating with themselves

because we are all ourselves
we are linked by the space we are made of
and instead of always diverging into different windows we can converge on some real things to do
that's where the concept of real comes from
now it's confusion is part of the fear factory of our modern media, who keep people lost

I think the old phobic trust building would be a good HQ for Generation Zero
the concrete phallus of Constable street pointing straight to the empty generation
the ones waiting to get it back

they are everyone, but they may not know it
consciousness is knowing

we all wander around with a dazzling viewport full of unconscious garbage
art is a proof of consciousness, or it can be

we have the chance to change things in this state of being actually connected to the spectacle

religion was used in the place of good enough consciousness, since it satisfies enough basic facts of the human experience

but what is good enough consciousness?
saving the planet

it's in the name, plan it.

there are a trove of pleasures available to you in this tiny window of opportunity known as now

it's only a possibility what you're likely to get up to
based on the state of the cosmos around you

the oil monster or something has shocked the consciousness into action
good

we'll keep it up
we'll feed it
feed ourselves the future we want

all the newspaper is trying to save you from is unconsciousness
news appeals to the spectacle seeker in a way that is harmful to consciousness

its about choosing what to make of it
some say we could do better
does anyone disagree with that?
the tools we were waiting for are here

philosophical language for relating everything to
it's around
it can converge

the truth is plenty

downtime mascots as a symptom of sudden convergence on unconsciousness

even the word consciousness seems to imply a grasping, oscillating and leveling out

our heart and soul disappeared indoors in front of the media
just when we got the tools to make change we lost our minds
not that it isn't good to lose your mind
when you're vivid about that kind of thing you can benefit a lot more from the path it's inevitably going to take
rock and roll is about being on a rock but also rolling with the moment you have your hands on
it's about a feeling
not just whispering divergent crap but yelling whatever approaches truth
becuase we make the truth

instead of filling you with flaws the media should be enabling human potential
potential for enjoying music and colour
without navigating a crazy ineffective interface
computers are the infinity machines
they provide everything we need they just need the bits they host to be one coherent piece of information so our abilities can scale with the power we have just around the corner from us

I look at the world's best pole dancer in a window
with trickles and kaka sounds I am aroused
the promise of a female soon I vaguely recall from some kind of announcer
the girl at the 7am end of my all night consciousness bender blumps into being
demanding my shame for Tsunami warnings in Chile

this gives homeowners the impression their household is massively contaminated
I mind the unconsciousness drone volume

rules must be made for stopping families of players betting on matches
brids eh

wish the night was easier to manage
to intuit potential forms in the creative flow
and end up in beautifull orchestrated dream

we need to diversify the kinds of text out there
get away from the monolithic derelict inducing

pushing the search into blokedom we went out into space in search of stuff we could find right here on earth
found strange abstractions of quantum decoration we left behind ourselves
what can we get out of it
the secret to buffetdom?

a dream I had
where everyone was waking up as "we're in this thing and we have been tricked into becoming things"
tons of puzers and pizers pack the stages
of bizarre panning news/entertainment camera swirling sets

starts with me at the top of a hill doing what I love
then I am looking at shoes I swapped with someone
then I am hitching rides, leaving my car almost to where I need to go, which is through the Hutt out
swapped shoes with Sam
while swapping music notes
while swapping flats
swapping rooms
thinking about moving walls
plumbing the compost with bits of keg and buckets (it sprays out at once and must be caught)
it always comes out with lots of black beans but I'm not sure where they come from

that's one... plot... it's me away from hitchhiking
then I intensely gaze and the scene changes

the news readers buzz
the puzers forty degrees over pack an oldschool Beatles on TV kinda stage but about 20 or so
other types of people around but they're quietly doing their jobs
whereas the newsreaders and the entertainers are loud
and sometimes have a bit of ad lib

is a chain
logic is in the end of chains
then flow is tract away & back
tractor has time
wormhole builds tractor
etc.
human also invented.

stuff managed behind a Travel ghost can provide for the stuff in front

chain is a hot word
Tractors with styles is more it
looking away from these screens when not absolutely necessary is the stuff

whack shit
as in jolt of clarity
easy to think
easy to see folding out into space
what now?

yeah, the universal consciousness... the spirit gateway is our hearts, a wholistic brain playing with a musical rubicks cube of DNA happenings, relative to how we FEEL, no lies (it's a non-dialectic, no "con tent" just vortexing vibes, check that shit out), including how we feel about our tribe so that's all pretty awol since before when machines were mice and men were lions... but yeah soon people With Culture will be sweet, that's where the mind is really building up quality, and how. it's just not on, y'know The News. also, harmonics. long waves. shits wild.

yep that's the naturre of the zaca zelps... it's the about the same at every magnification with local modulations on top, only gets confusing when your fractal (thought pattern) isn't compressing properly to get further around, but that's what this upward eroding language trip is for... it has all piled on so fast it must be language that puffs up our brains with new stuff, ya reckon? hmm... I gotta get back to my end of this but yeah numbers numbers. imo there's only 1-9 IN the universe tho, 0 is a building we made that made it possible to hang the guts out and calculate eg the harmonies in the planet's orbit, the first real trippy thing we found out about the moving stars from abstract stuff we picked up. anyway yeha moving stars. any expression opens space on a synapse. massive language moving around projects have not been undertaken yet, the internet is the most spastic end of this right now, it kinda goes. anyway yeah the hox gene in particular is important in that you need to invent some space to be able to do feng shui and make the embryo feel at home... check out http://ds9a.nl/amazing-dna/

and yeah play with the things until it coughs up the phenomena ..

 yin yangs too, flyingnuclearfroths of them intervibing mass while lines are drawn in time

fuck with your "is needed" capacitor

we need a dewey decimal system about the world's problems, mostly to point out which are in such concert that we could do away with vast swathes of them at once with only X and Y change to The Program.

There is always waiting. It begins in the still-dark morning when my dog barks at a sound I canât hear. I wait for R. to get out of bed and take her outside so I can go back to sleep. But really so I can go back to waiting.
