B..cell division
falling pieces
so loading up bb, the vector hash
fired through bz, lines of "$t $cv",$v
 is real protocoly point
 things can have bunches of style on them if you want to write "$t%$style $cv",$v
the multiplicity is everywhere, able to pack into spaces
unwind the spread 
kljlkjlkjl
ice skating
lets always $t\t$style\4$cv and read from the right
anyway that hangs out as a hash
also waves come off it and can also compress and hang out
some 4dish pattern tree
is the edge of it
the core is related hashes
the winding is 4dish pattern trees
from & to the jazz typewriter
fluid
[A
know A
check gaze mode
alignment
systems nudging
is the words
the stimuli is a change
the reaction container is based off
cold places etc
bz is a hot place
fast recoiling bits
should couple like so lang
cv is number
style is unlikely/unable to contain \t
so that working from right to left splitting off two tabs to find the thing, which could be anything
and so IT
is joining things up

sc followy
map hookups


my sideways write out
unity can issue from it
it is one of the two moments, the being ---
dividing itself into a negative, mixed up thing...

the worlds soul being spoken around, in finite existence... resolutions
traffickable
difference itself
as you add them together 
they are tautological
they say same stuff, different timespace...
like words trying to reac h the sphere pulse impulser
and virtue

so the way on the way in knows what args it wants?
maps in thje
remake pyramoidial that works inside pyramid
which is looking at how beings want to be related to each other or extrinsic and exist as pure beings, unattached to each other
j exude
"no difference in it" sounds miles light slip knot, the repulsionness of the bouncy synaptic talkyspace
convogation
convosation

black/white hole interweave
explaining itself to itself
we appear to be talking about stuff

typereiter going!

all listening until an J via W:
u codo
which outs compressed way edibles
harmony round the bell
love train
you will seem to fade out via W inc
Jinvolved via W can do codeforming tricks
send in by a name, if str we are usu
ie pi.
also u and n are now (not)style and Jn
u things start...stop and lv/interest

first n encaps u
lv catchops
from all these just-networked influencers

waves take on the world
the first can be from nowhere
u thing mods a being for itself, the elvisy W-dist result of thing gets applied to the J by the elvisy selfspace of qq
these qq things provide space to clash indexes together
for the local J.G.w looksee-do provisions canned fashions and bolts
many pieces flow through
the way receptico reverb river
but youre looking at stacking/importing Ws full of code to index
the ocean inside the boat

swag of T

so make J that see clashing Js, so c/sc can be sane
make the project for-insane, that is
for parties disagreeing
their nucleus should be opaque so as to leave plenty of room for realising faults etc

the MYTHOLOGY gets more perfected
to the way you read the N
brackets of re-elementing


run away to the run way, typewriter caRCRASH conveyorbelt
chuck together cars, see them painted fences - freqwuords

goya polisher head
driving down a road, tripping through a window
frequencies unveiling like cathedral upwards

the thing from afar can see its own further cv in the right side of t
while afar... chuck in the sun
the thing that stacks many things from many pi
and unifies the stringed and writ out code
is the Noodles, separation, <>< thing
more vertical it seems, maybe that's just now
categorise not, saturate or nullf
oonging soundt monkeys
filling up W by competition, everything chucks into W
but per process until something
look for the life/W/best.i, ensure hostname/hostkey/macdig
liney perfection is
how the thing is meaning the whole messy glob thats usually data
hang Js together by compining in sentences
called N, vibrating way, msucial arrangements
not only the planetary vector juxy
also the travelling bodies, tangential in time shapes
ping things by time, named bits being

do not listen to anyone 
use pha to add/rm on the I
chatty programs
they grab thinking by the c/sc
as it Intrails the t/W pha cones/Tinters
so it can pha exact and limit N into another sphere
a N limited with T to c.pi=clife
so we grab our code pools together as an infrastructural thing
always an extremity, a circle with a huge jut
so we can attach from many Ws their mentioned bits
through another separation, into one from Ws via qq
where the other side of canned rms by pha con, also 2 if the various updates brought change to the sphere
which may not be a difference once the whole thing is attached
so the I will take over the mod, mani
it knows by the time J anythinged how to line->C->mod
and how to deep fry via z
the things get in pha per /, so they can be goned
so as the I is Ting out the finds into a pha t bush



to I ways, is the A repeater
every move is addressed, incoming to T
well, who knows? its some chemicals right? bertween two heads? bursting way head
tango to slip in the frivostream some anchords overlapping the system
no mind to how to be bean
some aj guts wantr, even in separated outs
the remote will be available
make a tiny test syuite\

some in ajs style to flow on through others unseen into vats edified on the sentient side
that us, the body, tailing trailing end of response to stimuli via synapse
synapse is symbols flying into a curved space, w

always able to mod/ar/ate while things falls
so things falls, the top level juttering around time thresholds
sensitivity to the rushing condriac

Handy for those that like to get into a comment frenzy but aren't in the most agreeable mood.
How to compose a successful critical commentary:
-You should attempt to re-express your target‚Äôs position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, ‚ÄúThanks, I wish I‚Äôd thought of putting it that way.
-You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
-You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.
Daniel Dennett b. 28 march 1942

Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky.
Rainer Maria Rilke

Perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave.
Rainer Maria Rilke

I want to be with those who know secret things or else alone.
Rainer Maria Rilke

Spring has returned. The Earth is like a child that knows poems.
Rainer Maria Rilke

This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love: the more they give, the more they possess.
