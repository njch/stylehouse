its been round since the beginning
the idea
with distortion built in
it had to bootstrap its environment and ultimate being by itself from itself
life is order from chaos

life is an ongoing scultpure of order from chaos
a
any bit o life I talk to about their role in everything wants to distance itself from everything
because everything seems like an unconscious hellhole when it is in face the moment it is actually perceiving
the landscape we fashion
like downloading a whole bunch of some music instead of streaming it constantly
its about survival
of those higher life forms that we call music, culture

from the moment you are perceiving you can work towards a better moment
or more better moments in a general fashion
like a tribal culture or the thoughts of an artist collaborating with themselves
because we are all ourselves
we are linked by the space we are made of
and instead of always diverging into different windows we can converge on some real things to do
that's where the concept of real comes from
now it's confusion is part of the fear factory of our modern media, who keep people lost
I think the old phobic trust building would be a good HQ for Generation Zero
the concrete phallus of Constable street pointing straight to the empty generation
the ones waiting to get it back

they are everyone, but they may not know it
consciousness is knowing

we all wander around with a dazzling viewport full of unconscious garbage
art is a proof of consciousness, or it can be

we have the chance to change things in this state of being actually connected to the spectacle
religion was used in the place of good enough consciousness, since it satisfies enough basic facts of the human experience

but what is good enough consciousness?
saving the planet

it's in the name, plan it.

there are a trove of pleasures available to you in this tiny window of opportunity known as now

it's only a possibility what you're likely to get up to
based on the state of the cosmos around you

the oil monster or something has shocked the consciousness into action
good

we'll keep it up
we'll feed it
feed ourselves the future we want

all the newspaper is trying to save you from is unconsciousness
news appeals to the spectacle seeker in a way that is harmful to consciousness

its about choosing what to make of it
some say we could do better
does anyone disagree with that?
the tools we were waiting for are here

philosophical language for relating everything to
it's around
it can converge

the truth is plenty

downtime mascots as a symptom of sudden convergence on unconsciousness

even the word consciousness seems to imply a grasping, oscillating and leveling out

our heart and soul disappeared indoors in front of the media
just when we got the tools to make change we lost our minds
not that it isn't good to lose your mind
when you're vivid about that kind of thing you can benefit a lot more from the path it's inevitably going to take
rock and roll is about being on a rock but also rolling with the moment you have your hands on
it's about a feeling
not just whispering divergent crap but yelling whatever approaches truth
becuase we make the truth

instead of filling you with flaws the media should be enabling human potential
potential for enjoying music and colour
without navigating a crazy ineffective interface
computers are the infinity machines
they provide everything we need they just need the bits they host to be one coherent piece of information so our abilities can scale with the power we have just around the corner from us

I look at the world's best pole dancer in a window
with trickles and kaka sounds I am aroused
the promise of a female soon I vaguely recall from some kind of announcer
the girl at the 7am end of my all night consciousness bender blumps into being
demanding my shame for Tsunami warnings in Chile

this gives homeowners the impression their household is massively contaminated
I mind the unconsciousness drone volume

rules must be made for stopping families of players betting on matches
brids eh

wish the night was easier to manage
to intuit potential forms in the creative flow
and end up in beautifull orchestrated dream

we need to diversify the kinds of text out there
get away from the monolithic derelict inducing

pushing the search into blokedom we went out into space in search of stuff we could find right here on earth
found strange abstractions of quantum decoration we left behind ourselves
what can we get out of it
the secret to buffetdom?

a dream I had
where everyone was waking up as "we're in this thing and we have been tricked into becoming things"
tons of puzers and pizers pack the stages
of bizarre panning news/entertainment camera swirling sets

starts with me at the top of a hill doing what I love
then I am looking at shoes I swapped with someone
then I am hitching rides, leaving my car almost to where I need to go, which is through the Hutt out
swapped shoes with Sam
while swapping music notes
while swapping flats
swapping rooms
thinking about moving walls
plumbing the compost with bits of keg and buckets (it sprays out at once and must be caught)
it always comes out with lots of black beans but I'm not sure where they come from

that's one... plot... it's me away from hitchhiking
then I intensely gaze and the scene changes

the news readers buzz
the puzers forty degrees over pack an oldschool Beatles on TV kinda stage but about 20 or so
other types of people around but they're quietly doing their jobs
whereas the newsreaders and the entertainers are loud
and sometimes have a bit of ad lib

they interview JD one day

stuff managed behind a Travel ghost can provide for the stuff in front

chain is a hot word
Tractors with styles is more it
looking away from these screens when not absolutely necessary is the stuff

yeah, the universal consciousness... the spirit gateway is our hearts, a wholistic brain playing with a musical rubicks cube of DNA happenings, relative to how we FEEL, no lies (it's a non-dialectic, no "con tent" just vortexing vibes, check that shit out), including how we feel about our tribe so that's all pretty awol since before when machines were mice and men were lions... but yeah soon people With Culture will be sweet, that's where the mind is really building up quality, and how. it's just not on, y'know The News. also, harmonics. long waves. shits wild.

yep that's the naturre of the zaca zelps... it's the about the same at every magnification with local modulations on top, only gets confusing when your fractal (thought pattern) isn't compressing properly to get further around, but that's what this upward eroding language trip is for... it has all piled on so fast it must be language that puffs up our brains with new stuff, ya reckon? hmm... I gotta get back to my end of this but yeah numbers numbers. imo there's only 1-9 IN the universe tho, 0 is a building we made that made it possible to hang the guts out and calculate eg the harmonies in the planet's orbit, the first real trippy thing we found out about the moving stars from abstract stuff we picked up. anyway yeha moving stars. any expression opens space on a synapse. massive language moving around projects have not been undertaken yet, the internet is the most spastic end of this right now, it kinda goes. anyway yeah the hox gene in particular is important in that you need to invent some space to be able to do feng shui and make the embryo feel at home... check out http://ds9a.nl/amazing-dna/

and yeah play with the things until it coughs up the phenomena ..

36K is not enough
the browline of god carves out a whale
his single tear duct zooms into my crotch

the unfolding Hebrew letters, in your hands as you do the dance

the pin

the sprawluing field of maths education field
no wiring up equations but splaying out equatives
petal the spaces in between, long wavey

anyway the pin is 6ing in relatively to a juxtapo
cor spiral flows 3 to 7 in a pyramidroop, 8 further orbitals
but 6 leads to the right
7 shows the 3inging as it motions 4s to 6

if in iceage does the air up in the mountains get even thinner?

mozzies...

little media centers
that CAN grow into something that can metabolise The Problem properly
ventrickles
the Js are the contents, ways phase it
every fro or lev or whatever is like a lesser J
all that matters is the bb and passing it to maka
want to lev out a tuple to get onto the bollox J
put label, etc, the gpfro there
mozzie finally both out of the air, right by my right temple...

the pin hits you in the back of the head
if you do it right
kind of holds it together but only if you hold it together
never goes back cept to balance what you're holding
forwardy
4D

sculpt slacklines onto the code
so tautness can be drawn vast
look at a 'w ...(...)' thing
gather tatters of action its seen

gather tatters - hoss
a process can sit around being a dead pyramid database
its output gets chewed up...
inquired about
ask it about this way
L brackets could be redisd
hiss could limit flowing by J.ent
so we can move things around fast
casual ongoing entropy watch

the C though
make some
next J incant pulls things out of Cs
make so you can just chuck anything at it of course
but if the magneticsm is right it turns into blah
so it is the codon
that is the vasty of the Jness
 - make event pop boldness on whatever you aiming at
 - Ctrl click holsters thing
 - next click hopefully swooshes its meaning into there
but probly more like the code is in a J with introversion tools on top
so you can waft through the styles by hitting keys
that's the 5ery applicator
beating code into shape & deciding how to look at live runnings
jitterbug isolatable
everything isolatable
shake him by the hand, make it continuous
and ofcors modulate down to Cs again
group them
crabby special effect
 
like injecting if J then messome into patches

sos DNA, and it totally gives you heaps of powers for magnetism to glory, the compression patterns... blagging... babbling..
to me it's like a huge drug trip! fuck it. this is graet tho, got me to put a bunch of art in front of ... myself.
because the community is fabricated with dialectic. the highest artists I know seem to use it like an infinite feng shui training ground.
specimen mindedness though... anyway it's in the medium now since nobody is here but me it seems. man someone oughtta sort out this internet thing there's so much to gert thorf

spawn the inness into the J,
oundo pours out under the most in vines
so u is all the randoms, squeezed down once u/geh is chased
so the chute that it squeezes down can be massaged to prov dynam
provide dynamo!
ash radar
 so all cultuvated, belonging to the objects flowing through (while..)
 hangs/gardens in Jon
to be shadowed into J
all bits of inness, clumping around with tuples
remember the break row-dom whenever
inness collectors items
trail mix down into time
then whatever particulars are accumulated
 - sucked into another J, going to modulate further
 - say into some file
 or the conduit leading there,
 a J at the side, extracting into a mod pattern as its fed

inness is the everything radar
things are hitched into yolks
know about everything in stylehouse where there's a fs='~/styleshed' there's ghosts/J/0:whatever
but also ghosts/J is that
and ghosts/J/0 is also an aspect of that which is inside it
layers more liquid at J/0 than J

big permeatron

the yolk is modulated into something that can run or serialise
and pumped thereways, becoming resources
make tape machine for anywhere ashings...
any yodeling and its F stick
reverb there would be great
if theres a J for the zip bit
zip bit is where the code may be able to flow creativly
if the surroundings are animated...
so bridge that way to the zong pinacle just below the textbox
zong is upside down inness with tons of stuff on the floor...

so

it hsa all these ways

brimming domes
we could not hear me
from the arc angle
now swimming around a dome that must be somewhere
that somewhere, smokering vectors and life

Z J passes R.way injection
Z opens things with some usual circumference
a Codon, etc
a Codo, a potentially-live batch
all them ghostfiles inject into R

slow distillation process
J for xray of mars
J for
typing stuff while watching footage from docos on slomo
needs a good upward thrust
come here go away is a pattern with them
circle/line tours

simpering
along
waves of tidy

so ya hiJ bollox sur
and it'll makeJ named bollox and Jup it with the personality switchboard found in 
*/styJup/sur which expands into 'thesurf' and 'sur' in that case
'thesurf' is a curve to use and 'sur' is the resonator
so then various calls to */curves hits thesurf/curves since etc.
the J is a base space for specifying quantum space vectors, so any one can arrange other Js any ways, like art art art.
and there's all this language to goo it together.
