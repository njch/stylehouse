  Something
    
    next type of chain...

    chains takeover sections of the wormhole
    into a namespace * path situation
    
    a way can become a promise
    so singular events
     like starting the top level action to a bunch of ghosts
      can 
    
    
    Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations such as scaling, reflection, and rotation; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, theoretic models, language, music and even knowledge itself.

  G splat travels from another T
    Way In is constructed before travelling
      or travel will create one
    way in is a chain constructed by the traveller
    chain is a proto Tractor, working with whatever for now
    soon to be grabbing chunks of ghost ob?
    
    Tractor is a bridge to madness
     so the G->W is clean
     the Tractor is G Gf(tractor)
    
    So the bridge is A[$someid, $picture]
     those args and their contents can be sanified
     each chain of traction is defined in the Codon
    
    Codons with traction have the W/tractor Ghost attached
     that is used for A[]
     when you have $A (tractor chain (Way))
     
     the field in front of any point is a race for language
    for sane proto
    
    Ghost needs a way follower for stack trace intelligence
     Ghost seems to move through w, doo, eval & __ANON__
     
     you can see the events come in from Mojo, Texty
    
    somewhere, someone got the human spirit and put it in a recognisable form
    
    
  
      keep reading
    back trails
  
    intron is ghost splat + codon ui
    in lyrico
      ghost trail
    menu to relative intron
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
     yeo. fadeout effect cool as.
       tool for zapping divs away.
       
      make space
      travel errors+messages into a wormhole we can apply tractors to
      
      get into the Codon ghost 
      
      splat makes wormholes -> lines -> R -> B
      opening the line could mean anything
      so every step requires a haunt,
       L/splat-line finds a tractor for that $line to make a R
         L/splat-R finds a tractor for each B
           L/splat-B returns v
       so it finds a ghost
        to return a chain to make the style phase work

  enlarge codolist things by attention
  
  yes
  
  here we are in a space again
  stable and unstable in the same process
  ghosts from the bucky
  the webs
  peel open the etractors to the replacement crawls
  
  
  try apply space more
  event comes in and recurses all the way up O to H
    with a bunch of action todo
  
  turn?
  measure & apply attention
  
  Codo is what it's trying to do
  
  some of my art looks like an insideout desert creature trying to move
  
  nower living
  
  stylehouse retroglaze
  business card leads here
  
  all the interstuff will envaginate, turn to mush
  
  mojo connect to mojo
  
  js error - do something up here
  
  hey hey

  scrape https://github.com/st3vil/stylehouse/graphs/traffic
  cacti land somewhere
  
  
  lyrico speaks intron
  
  pass menu stretches around codon traffic
  
  turn on TT
  make lots of pictures
  
  (trav depth limit)(splat depth limit) and searching for specifics
  in either
  finding the way to WAlB from WBlA (surface puncture, trav like cache)
  seeing that nearby on the chain
  
  pv in pipes somewheres
  
  maybe they're all text one day
  
  where can I talk to myself?
  
    $self is anywhere
    the attachment defines what it is
    otherwise it's the variable
    a
