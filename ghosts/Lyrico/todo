  Psyche!
    Yep
    Welcome to the post-ward 
    I get a glimpse of Sam Fischer just before I leave
     just like tlc
     He says spacebible.com
    A song says let's go bailhouse
    doing it taps it into being
    being '
    being
    
    converse nurse
    don't go down the wormhole if there are too many rules right there
    
    all the people were in to music, painting or hardcore maths
      I should have asked for a mathematician
    
    what do you do? pure maths
    
    my friends got to see me again
    
  Aaron is the law & money guy
      but he says he prefers not to use money
      money being traceable (waste land)
    
    get started eh
    
    all the houses are facing the wrong way
      they want to point north (in the southern hemisphere)
      and tilt up
      the sun is there
    
    it was a walk in the park
    
    by the way
    
    get their notes
    
    Yep
    
    Yep
    should be able to see the place where the drugs are made
    
      all the same.
    
    dont listen but understand.
  Something
    chains takeover sections of the wormhole
    into a namespace * path situation  
      the B_ pk value is a chain
      
    chains lead through functions and structures
    
    next type of chain... spawned from each other
    crawl thing becomes a thing chain
    then...
    
    HUT!
    SICKLE!

    Prof Lue Calfman`s quote from G
    try looking through the manpage for "ip"
        There`s a lot to wade through, but there`s a few things there that could help you, like "ip addr", "ip route", maybe even "ip link". It's probably not the easiest method, but I'll bet it's possible

    chains takeover sections of the wormhole

    a way can become a promise
    so singular events
     like starting the top level action to a bunch of ghosts
      can 
    
    
    Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations such as scaling, reflection, and rotation; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, theoretic models, language, music and even knowledge itself.

  G splat travels from another T
    Way In is constructed before travelling
      or travel will create one
    way in is a chain constructed by the traveller
    chain is a proto Tractor, working with whatever for now
    soon to be grabbing chunks of ghost ob?
    
    Tractor is a bridge to madness
     so the G->W is clean
     the Tractor is G Gf(tractor)
    
    So the bridge is A[$someid, $picture]
     those args and their contents can be sanified
     each chain of traction is defined in the Codon
    
    Codons with traction have the W/tractor Ghost attached
     that is used for A[]
     when you have $A (tractor chain (Way))
     
     the field in front of any point is a race for language
    for sane proto
    
    Ghost needs a way follower for stack trace intelligence
     Ghost seems to move through w, doo, eval & __ANON__
     
     you can see the events come in from Mojo, Texty
    
    somewhere, someone got the human spirit and put it in a recognisable form
    
    
  keep reading - back trails
    
    Chains can arr_if $G->wd
  
    intron is ghost splat + codon ui
    in lyrico
      ghost trail
    menu to relative intron
  
  
  
  
  
  
  yeo. fadeout effect cool as.
       tool for zapping divs away.
       
      make space
      travel errors+messages into a wormhole we can apply tractors to
      
      get into the Codon ghost 
      
      splat makes wormholes -> lines -> R -> B
      opening the line could mean anything
      so every step requires a haunt,
       L/splat-line finds a tractor for that $line to make a R
         L/splat-R finds a tractor for each B
           L/splat-B returns v
       so it finds a ghost
        to return a chain to make the style phase work
  
  
  
  
  
  hostinfo
    for modules, IPs, files, everything
    anything storage upgradable to sticky schemas

    modules create a view div, fill it with spans
    the spans' ids reach back to the module and/or controller it came from
    passing it the whole element and "click" or whatever
    lets eval everything from a WebSocket on the client

    new screens/websockets attached to screen/tx

    by the event dispatch... we see the waters edge
    blowing up and coming back down in a linguatic clang
    here to think about what to do

    need to error check client side javascript

    Texty, sending things through hostinfo awaits knowing about which screen its on
    handled by whatever provisions the viewport

    the modes that programs go through...
     - like awaiting event

    dump hostinfo to a file (in another window)

    going into the jungle horizontal
    come out vertical again and pick up the dream

    the tri is a point of balance

    everything exists from two places

    the unfolding along the texty line... jostling into space

    yep line jostling
    span spannering
    space building
    program cursor
    tubes of where what & how
