    so when the @} gets clicked we want to add more bendy from this hash

    the line can also T
    esp in the case of 9 or 6 when it goes back through itself
    it wanders through as numbers weigh it down, define how it curls
    so it shows a top level of where things are around a line
    
    so the line wants lots of personality
    even shifting textures
    
    mainly
     - how the J starts
       that L angle defining the character of diparting from the trunk
       flowing in or selecting in
     - how to curves
    
    so the sketch: db
    looks like a coupling inside a dome
    which implies the dome couples as well
    and so it flows around J, jumping in out by yeah

    things fu with A and the R
    R Js can be used to takeover sections of A, etc.
    
    Cs get created into R.A.n_C
    fi, fuu, etc assumed on the G.R
    
    so R handles Action, has its ways to catch up percolating changes
    where other R, say U R, have hooked in
    to suck in new sheet of data
    
    sheet a thing you wanna chew up lots, in real time then automated (devolf)
    feels like 5, where it starts bending crazy
    
    which reflects the change, does S or whatever to build out the meaning
    constructing the J from a linear set of R.A
    
    
    
    S is really the uxd input organiser, doesnt curl away yet...
    
    uxdily it bAmboos the J form
        from linear set got from origin R.A.n_C
        
      this should find the direction
        look for downward linking between them and nest
        
    Sily it styles the J
        form from functions looking at data
        pi forms
        nesting pi forms
    
    both these build style with direction to the bunch to express
    
    that Jish style may have lots of instructions
    
     3 create the ux Cs, stealing exact replicas from already
      tractor beam ux Cs somewhere (R.A.n_ux)
      but really they unify as this sheet of style rolls over
      as the style is the truth
      
      uxs and styles involved get chances to do stuff
      
      more and more bamboo as the style swooshes in
      
      
    so tractor beams out to other R (U R)
    U R would quickly rebuild its own relative Action with new input

      but if a bunch of J through time sets the js lamda a.fu.nc

    eg a.fu.nc = whatevers
    throwing stuff at lambda fort via some js
    the stream of synapse, updating a.fu.nc (=/D) this
    the rock holds that collects J can compress backwards things written forwards

    
    compress style to the last whole thing it was setting up
    styles may set the js lamda a.fu.nc
    keep the last one that did in the elvibe spool
    drop the older spools as they spool away

      the modern U will consume an R for set instruction...
      which it translates to objects native to their end realities
      so it is flowing to styley
      to T and generate more J relating to their nativity (jquery cmds)
      
      modern U with whatever to make it whatever
      eats style
      or something that you would feed to R to get style:
       - a set of one or more $u like old ux
       
       - travel on A to get stuff
       
      and of course voltages decay...
      so it can be slightly interested in things around it
      but travel on the interesting things
      
      then all that is structured in a kinda J
      which is the jutt of shapes
      the whole jutt, style bunch
      interesting things are held in J
        the jutt of shapes
        with clues about how they hang together
        a place for whatever culture
        as the J and as style in J.c
        like a little magnet holding stuff out of the void
        
        
      a style is a one-line shape...
      
      j - usually too small to see
      one line from the style bunch of du, of J
      looks like:
          "{loc{at{or 0.3" => $value,
        '{id 0.0' => $id,
        '{name' => 'yab', # maybe, probly as injection
        '{GGs 0.3' => $v_etc_regulated_pi_sculpt?, # hmmmmm
      
      so it may have vectors after \S+
      and value keyed by that
      so it sorts
      and has voltages to decay by later
      can be used internally to pass around refs in little drawings together
      and stringifies easy enough
      
      two stylehousen would talk like this
      exchanging objects first, talking datastructures into the host
      then some style does something when its hit
      in the process
      
      which sounds like injecting ways into a dome
      "do this with this here and this here and this..."
      
      "* 1-4" => $Dome,
      "* 5-9" => $thiswaytoo,
      
      style can be added too...
      '{name'=>$name,
      '%co'=>$colour,
      or whatever
      applying them is the ticket to nature
      
      so that whatever emits style can play the style game
      which can have many layers
      
      if $a is passed to pi, etc.
      if no $a, string description of the thing
      either case is filing everything immediately there into its voltages
      which means it kinda knows whats there
      interesting is what it doesnt know but is there
      then something would grep out voltages up to a point
      and do something with the style there
      
      so surf R does top level stuff on the pis of the J splat
      
      this level 
      
      so the style applied with 
      which may be all htmlish but hope not
      applying them styles is important
      many codons clicking the invention into place
      in the namespace of the styles
      may be lots of sharing somehow
      
      it gets Ud into the style="" or whatever
      
      compressing style in html by percolating into the <style>
      and using class names and tag names to relate
      
      so ideally styles like %h1, %h2 should change tag names, apply enough style to make the thing a 
          
      which is a percolation of well known styles into stylesheets and class names to aplpy
      having that developerment go soothly there would be good
      
      so the surf R could be interested in rowing out { and styling in %
      oldschool was html concat with inspection
      html is made by gp since
      
      
      extra windings of concepts:
      what if just \S? J meaning?
      'content';
      
        
      as string 
      
      let C:j babble up a j
      holds style on j.c
      can do useful stuff
      this du output vaguely like a hash of 
      
      which is a j, usually too small to see
      but there are a few 
      
      which may touch many other styles since its openish lingo
      
      which swim upwards doing magic as the U draws together boxes
      
      but you probably want to travel on A to get stuff...
      
      so you can style things in the wanted
      
      # style surf

      i is anything
      we develop

      hit R with G
      its self headlines through pi

      then it shows you a compression of

      but that might as well be line 0 
      which like a Z call is in l with the others to be near it as we drift ofer there

      of other ways
      
      ways can be fractured into braids along 1-9 markers in the code
      the new way is 
      but if a braided way is used
      you are defining a new way in the G (probably)
      with a human name
        as a sequence of other codes to incorporate
          as say S1-4 + proto_S
          proto_S chewing on data different to S5-9
          but they occupy the same space relative to the other process
          there could be a bunch of levels of this
        and some extra glue
      which flies into the R via G0
      it splices new code together
      or uses chunks its already braided apart from the unified 1-9 instance of the code
      could be defined in C or as a $R->w(S1-7,
      
      
      0/R, etc Ghosts that override *R::whatever to new D
      like a diff on top of l/ from startup
      then theres a spot for everything to slide off into compilation

      3 is the code input
       braid finisher
       & interrupter

      Alternatively, the RNA transcript could be edited several different ways by cellular machinery ( post-transcriptional RNA editing, splicing, insertion of uracil or cytosine bases within the transcript, capping, adding a tail, etc.). Then, you have translation of the message by the ribosomes, post-translational modification of the protein (cleavage of the protein, export to the cellular membrane, addition of sugars and lipids to specific amino acid residues). There are even proteins that may help the protein to fold correctly.
           So an actual stretch of DNA with exons and introns might look like this:

      ACTUAL CODE<!-- blah blah blah blah ---- blah -->ACTUAL CODE
        |         |            |           |        |        |
      exon 1    acceptor    intron 1     branch   donor   exon 2
           (start of comment)                 (end of comment)
      The start of the comment is clear, which is then followed by a lot of non-coding DNA. Somewhere very near the end of the comment there is a 'branch site', which indicates that the comment will end soon. Then some more comment follows, and then the actual terminator.
      The actual cutting of the comments happens after the DNA has been transcribed into RNA and is performed by looping the comment and bringing the pieces of actual code close together. Then the RNA is cut at the 'branch site' near the end of the comment, after which the 'acceptor' (comment start) and 'donator' (comment end) are connected to eachother.

       DNA is rooms full of machines, RNA is happenings, music. 1-9 and 0=up/whole exists, is growing. Everything has the same shape real nice. Yin yans, from s and e around tori/spheres.

    At what levels do it seem to be a sphere vs torus we are happening in.
    Sometimes there's a line it crosses, say in $G->D
    Sometimes it's a tubular thing like some flow of an $R, which is the ghost's protractor for a braid.
    See how R machinery unwraps a c placed on the R to match the language barrier (spin) of the other hemisphere
    language barrier is like a trench of arguments slowly extending as the language grows
    philosily closely related to giving arguments to functions, the names qualities and in reality sequencing of those things developing and murkifying over time is the krishna, kill factor, q-factor-creator of the lambda fort/mountain that your creation is a .. linguistic model. of synapse.
    the energy level of truth in a pile of synapse.

    there's many eclectic electric snakes coiling around in the torus, smashing their faces into the skin to create indents, like inductance.
    you can see it on that painting we'll call ACGT until I get it to you... it's the big golden chicken foetus/egg with black pyramid, lots of grinding, silver goldfish swimming up around, 1 and 1/2 spheres.
    that's a map of the unfoldment, possible through a straight line and a curvy line, then it goes around.
    so that's like the yin yan where dots define a N S axis and the curve is the synaptic pathway it took. the whole is what you see in your head right now.
    the winding of the coil, spacing and numbering and grouping the wires,has been related to optimising efficiency of the vortex. these vague top level things define the vague top level things observable about the phenomenon that it is.
    important for things that continue reacting forever, such as we are most interested in.

    insect wings.... yess... spiders webs. locomotion on the creation-train.
    compositing wormholes and redividing resources like attention, space.
    I have a flock of stylehuts and one stylehouse. there's an abandoned shed I might burn later somehow.
    the T deals with four dimensions at once. (content revision)
    is a time-crystalising machine
    so braids... set into an R the diagonal line unravels the c into an s by the way, see how it curves back after halfway down?
    a vortex of 12 sounds real good.
    the ACGT painting has 9 lights leading up the left side of the black pyramid. underneath is the corner of that same pyramid (as if I paint it again on paper and tear off the corner) lodged there like a left behind bit of blutacked collage. that pyramid, in the earth or whatever, has 3 lights up the side of it.
    so far the numbers feel like
    1 dimensional setup
    2 self aware
    3 creative
    4 humms
    5 links
    6 travels

    so stuff "at" 2, vis T, could be replayed from, getting creative afresh.
    humms balances out various existential forces
    
    links makes synapse, eg the will to do something, do something later, do this thing when doing that thing later, etc.
    
    that "when doing that thing later" is missing part, like a drip tray
    
    R will soon be good enough to support the
    language trench development well enough to raise
    the ceiling on the dev process very much.

    do spiders think of the web as a worm?
    it has holes.
    the old web has lost and alosrt of lines,
    enough to define a whole page where ever you look.
    the new web is jazz geometry.
    which is why nobody can hold it properly yet.
     
    also why things take all this pageyness. in postgresql a massive database server there's a concept of a page in the optimisation config, a page is the smallest thing you read from disk at a time - or you read yay many pages in a row or whatever. 


    all the data maps onto disk, you see, much abstract to the programmer nowadays but for huge databases that architecture needs to be really tight so there's these clues about the pathways of reality. 
     #c caring
    
    every well atomised subroutine has this fractal look reflecting the shape of the 1-9 happenings.
    it bulges around 6 (which is 2/3s of the way down, hanging like a gut...) where logic/grouping or iteration of a list has made indentation of blocks containing more code.
    a sub is like a block with a name it can be found by, lexical variables from within the block cease to exist outside that block. the curly section of an if ($some) { ... } statement is also a block. they build pyramids that nest together overlapping concepts and wiring vast stretches of reality into each other. the whole of a running stylehouse is hanging out of one block somewhere that has not yet returned. it finds ways to coil around and feel time.

    anyway the DNA (axioms ACGT) are carpentry of the spheres

    it will spin a mosaic of sound and light for miles and miles
    art vortexing. it gets spawn through the vortex into a train of J. line and curve. smallest graspable chunk of change (at whatever level). a sentence. an incremental change.
    
    so the tape comes out as Js.
    they gets sent to elvi.
    they might be code to run that updates objects,
      such is information, which might update html or whatever the stuff is we are streaming stimuli into.
    and then there's all these huge tapes of culture to go and play back.
    the tape is then an vortexed image of a wormhole life, a movie of the wormhole happening. wormholes also modulate into themselves like a freeze dried state for communicating, saving to disk.
    then the tapes can be shared with metadata, bringing them into the web.

    so all the subroutine calls all over are little Js as well. big spinny bush of synapse.

   Codon so braided is the code splitting horse
   a sequence of Codon lines:  'ෙ ෙ ෙ'
   moving and applying styles vs having them in a tube already... 'dolphin bubble rings'

   these pods are in the diagonal grid formation
   which can hold spirals of base9 addition
     travel in pixels of 1, 9x9, 16x16.
     
     the Ds is this line that doesnt curve now
     but _braid and _trail and last.ux show curvey
     
     so the spiral can go out many layers... or in?
     
     the purpose of scientific method is to select from among a multitude of hypothesis
     spiraling vortex arty vagueness obviously helps hugely with over-the-edge stuff
     
   info alive, style etc 'control' it # Say, Doing more stuff in plywood layers
        # stages of Ds could have namey index for lingobs
        # all that compiles into regular old subs
        # writ to G::U and so on later for speeeed
        
        # do not try twist it around in run time
        # although simple tricks should work...
        
        # this is crazy shit
        # lambda Y like a wave - through points - deeper - scaling up (which is down)

          what L.o means already, more from grappling        varieties
        
        we can inject meanwhile into Ds, fractionating complexity
        this could make list processing that eases dimensional judderbar hops
        like adaptive maps & greps & ...
        
        Ds would have a form of A too
        language stretching across it, turning high level bits on and off

        it calls braid to run a given Ds
        iterates Ds->[Di
        it iterates Ds, sets 
        anTop does current D, which travels
        Y moves L out from the braidu
        wordu means the unified end of word
        
      -    # the ux's Ds involved can invoke another braid
      -    #   or another anTop
      -    # to run different dimensions from a centrifuge with a fractal shape bleeding from T
      -    # like the root of $T is now, _braid, _trail, everything running around is deeper
      -    # the other end of $T is the unified field
      -    
      -    # args to anTop may change i from inside the braid for recursion
      -    # or Dw if top
      -    # T._braid._no_circles catches recursion via _trail.i
      -    # and yeah... we are in already and return to from anTop the top of the braid

      chow is undirected synapse energy
      stuff up in [o but going nowhere, due to missing some part of the language curve
      the [o is interesting
      gets transacted at different angles... kinda grouped by w.O for now, also probably by w.G and so on
      this stuff may have changed recently (this [o stuff)
      or subtracted
      or it may be getting watched and filtered and triggerised and hit 3 million times per second
        such operations point through accum & deaccum

      like chains contain bunches of language that get fired sometimes and sometimes and sometimes
      the chain itself could start deciding how to move
      or the effect of such anyway
      given that the chain is a Way and w.G is a ghost maintaining the Way's squishinessby squishinesssquish,  kompressibility, mostly via K
      but also B[, and anything else important
      so basically to compress/serialise the way:
        K, e + difference of some kind of blank or stationary Way descriptor
        and the ...
        
        yeah the difference from a default K
        is the K+B{ ish identity of the Way, which can be saved into into some text field for storage
        such acompressedness would go well in a database situation
        esp if the esp if pg_perl still exists and can adapt queries to Ways
        yeah so Ways can fit into database schemas.
        or you could fit the database schema over rthe way.

    I can build stuff to explain these number systems soon. his work is really inspiring because it conveys in riddles from a vortex of unknowable truth.

    the lambda function (upside down y) is the number one symbol of the vague cult of computer people that actually "know" about computers, it's been making the people that try go funny for ages.

    perhaps because of the number system being a crucial clue to the exuder of form once you get down to grains like lambdas, and the confusion around lambda is akin to not knowing about the base 10 system being these other two systems composited together.

    BUT that's if you want to go all the way down to there, someone will before long... But I can not look much more at that and save our NZ, which is the whole trick, what is meant by "spiral" most of the time, but that lambda madness will be more up for grabs from what I build.

    I have worked out lots more traction with genetics, if they got me MHActed again I could definitely get support from scientists. I just don't know how to get support now while I'm still a punter writing code that isn't enlightening people. that's the whole trick, getting there.

    so stylehouse is harmonising with Rodin's theories. it's good when things seem to want to grow more later but don't need to right now. it's good to have stuff lying around to expand peoples brains with too, it is a thought-as-vibrations-that-produce-harmony/space/sparks thing, language as evolving stock, belief as power, total cultivation.

    instead of pages and pages of someone's lingo, the dialectic involved here is more dynamic and hyperlinking, which can make a lot more interesting stuff happen in your brain while you have all these half understood things lying around like always.

    it's get some thinking going like that or spend forever living in insecticide world. they behave like insects because their computers don't hold their consciousness good enough and they end up serving them like poorly understood but unavoidable masters, of numbers over people, re life.

    this is the real state of the mind that I'm reaching for with stylehouse. anyway I'm gunna get in there or it's never going to get online and show people...
line drivers often have to be located as close to bonding pads as possible;
chip area is therefore in some cases given a minimum area in order to fit in the required number of pads;
areas are clustered in order to limit data paths thus frequently featuring defined structures such as cache RAM, multiplier, barrel shifter, line driver and arithmetic logic unit;
purchased intellectual property blocks (IP-blocks), such as a processor core, come in predefined area blocks;
some IP-blocks come with legal limitations such as permitting no routing of signals directly above the block.

  A Tractor is a floating bridge to an expected wormholiness
      
      "export" the way 'Arr' from to make Tw bridge to G tractor
      Tw is a T with wayish point/$ar
      the bridge is $A = A[$someid, $picture]
      $A is the horizontal inside
      in $G _lwp you can grab A/whatever

     defining B_  is like a PK on the OGW (using retract)
       two B_ meeting from each line
       so we can find the same "thing" in a pair of wormholes

      opening the line could mean anything
      so every step requires a haunt,
       L/splat-line finds a tractor for that $line to make a R
         L/splat-R finds a tractor for each B
           L/splat-B returns v
