    In some approaches the floorplan may be a partition of the whole chip area into axis aligned rectangles to be occupied by IC blocks. This partition is subject to various constraints and requirements of optimization: block area, aspect ratios, estimated total measure of interconnects, etc.

    bonding pads for off-chip connections
      u (an i way) is a chip
      u.Li ||= travel u: |
        
    chips are 2d. another u is 3d.
    (often using wire bonding) are normally located at the circumference of the chip;

    wires are off
    wires contains
line drivers often have to be located as close to bonding pads as possible;
chip area is therefore in some cases given a minimum area in order to fit in the required number of pads;
areas are clustered in order to limit data paths thus frequently featuring defined structures such as cache RAM, multiplier, barrel shifter, line driver and arithmetic logic unit;
purchased intellectual property blocks (IP-blocks), such as a processor core, come in predefined area blocks;
some IP-blocks come with legal limitations such as permitting no routing of signals directly above the block.

    next type of chain...
      tracably spawned through each other & G happs
    they can relate things to thir surroundings too
    
    
    chains takeover sections of the wormhole
      by providing the i and o of T
      *-* linkage that feeds the crawl of T()
    
    Tractors manage a wormhole
      providing namespace
       by delegating levels to yonder Tractors down the O chain
    
    so it comes back to being a chain of ghosts with tractors in
       then that chain can be thrashed however
       and manipulate the matrix of things it pretends to be
    
    a way can become a promise
    so singular events
     like starting the top level action to a bunch of ghosts

    Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations such as scaling, reflection, and rotation; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, theoretic models, language, music and even knowledge itself.

    the creativity spiral needs a vortex
        to pull in the things it means
        while spinning you AROUND the coming IT, through time
        and not out in to space,

  A Tractor is a floating bridge to an expected wormholiness
      
      "export" the way 'Arr' from to make Tw bridge to G tractor
      Tw is a T with wayish point/$ar
      the bridge is $A = A[$someid, $picture]
      $A is the horizontal inside
      in $G _lwp you can grab A/whatever
        and chain/hack on for case
    
     defining B_  is like a PK on the OGW (using retract)
       two B_ meeting from each line
       so we can find the same "thing" in a pair of wormholes
         with something to do together like percolate events from tips
    
    Tw is a jumble while easily chucking meaningful way into T awaits..
     tractors are arrived by sanity with those things
    
    Codons with traction have the W/tractor Ghost attached
     that is used for A[]
     when you have $A (tractor chain (Way))
     
     the field in front of any point is a race for language

      splat makes wormholes -> lines -> R -> B
      opening the line could mean anything
      so every step requires a haunt,
       L/splat-line finds a tractor for that $line to make a R
         L/splat-R finds a tractor for each B
           L/splat-B returns v
       so it finds a ghost
        to return a chain to make the style phase work
