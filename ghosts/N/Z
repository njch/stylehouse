      H eats G0 Ϡ when ways splice & dice
      any D is a way at source
      that is finding C via K from the G.A.n_way...
      that is finding a C within a C

      G0 receives update
      reinjects the way into the running thing
      
      ways are a lexical scope of code
      smaller chunks are about the 1-9 fractal space
      into tiny codes at known sorta algorithm points
      so fractures can be recomposed
      to anarchise the essential, source way
      loading the algorithm with extras
      
      or forking a way...

      ways can be fractured into braids along 1-9 markers in the code
      the new way is 
      but if a braided way is used
      you are defining a new way in the G (probably)
      with a human name
        as a sequence of other codes to incorporate
          as say S1-4 + proto_S
          proto_S chewing on data different to S5-9
          but they occupy the same space relative to the other process
          there could be a bunch of levels of this
        and some extra glue
      which flies into the R via G0
      it splices new code together
      or uses chunks its already braided apart from the unified 1-9 instance of the code

       DNA is rooms full of machines, RNA is happenings, music. 1-9 and 0=up/whole exists, is growing. Everything has the same shape real nice. Yin yans, from s and e around tori/spheres.

    At what levels do it seem to be a sphere vs torus we are happening in.
    Sometimes there's a line it crosses, say in $G->D
    Sometimes it's a tubular thing like some flow of an $R, which is the ghost's protractor for a braid.
    See how R machinery unwraps a c placed on the R to match the language barrier (spin) of the other hemisphere
    language barrier is like a trench of arguments slowly extending as the language grows
    philosily closely related to giving arguments to functions, the names qualities and in reality sequencing of those things developing and murkifying over time is the krishna, kill factor, q-factor-creator of the lambda fort/mountain that your creation is a .. linguistic model. of synapse.
    the energy level of truth in a pile of synapse.

    there's many eclectic electric snakes coiling around in the torus, smashing their faces into the skin to create indents, like inductance.
    you can see it on that painting we'll call ACGT until I get it to you... it's the big golden chicken foetus/egg with black pyramid, lots of grinding, silver goldfish swimming up around, 1 and 1/2 spheres.
    that's a map of the unfoldment, possible through a straight line and a curvy line, then it goes around.
    so that's like the yin yan where dots define a N S axis and the curve is the synaptic pathway it took. the whole is what you see in your head right now.
    the winding of the coil, spacing and numbering and grouping the wires,has been related to optimising efficiency of the vortex. these vague top level things define the vague top level things observable about the phenomenon that it is.
    important for things that continue reacting forever, such as we are most interested in.

    insect wings.... yess... spiders webs. locomotion on the creation-train.
    compositing wormholes and redividing resources like attention, space.
    I have a flock of stylehuts and one stylehouse. there's an abandoned shed I might burn later somehow.
    the T deals with four dimensions at once. (content revision)
    is a time-crystalising machine
    so braids... set into an R the diagonal line unravels the c into an s by the way, see how it curves back after halfway down?
    a vortex of 12 sounds real good.
    the ACGT painting has 9 lights leading up the left side of the black pyramid. underneath is the corner of that same pyramid (as if I paint it again on paper and tear off the corner) lodged there like a left behind bit of blutacked collage. that pyramid, in the earth or whatever, has 3 lights up the side of it.
    so far the numbers feel like
    1 dimensional setup
    2 self aware
    3 creative
    4 humms
    5 links
    6 travels
    7 traction
    8 infinity
    9 returns
  J
    on the other side of a conceptual ravine I can't remember, something takes 1 to mean "dimensional set up". there's lots of stuff like that around but my brain is sliding now.

    so stuff "at" 2, vis T, could be replayed from, getting creative afresh.
    humms balances out various existential forces
    links makes synapse, eg the will to do something, do something later, do this thing when doing that thing later, etc.
    that "when doing that thing later" is missing part.
    R will soon be good enough to support the language trench development well enough to raise the ceiling on the dev process very much.
    also having the wormholes compositing together like a shadow from many stuff happening in the constellation.
    do spiders think of the web as a worm? it has holes. the old web has lost and alosrt of lines, enough to define a whole page where ever you look. the new web is jazz geometry. which is why nobody can hold it properly yet.
    also why things take all this pageyness. in postgresql a massive database server there's a concept of a page in the optimisation config, a page is the smallest thing you read from disk at a time - or you read yay many pages in a row or whatever. 


    all the data maps onto disk, you see, much abstract to the programmer nowadays but for huge databases that architecture needs to be really tight so there's these clues about the pathways of reality. 



    eh what else... so 1-9 repeats in sections and ways sometimes. phases generate energy that can be laterally comparsed by other ways. ways is way is a C, a human language chunk.
    R juggles a bunch of these and tries to compile the best code for doing whatever it seems to be doing.
    every well atomised subroutine has this fractal look reflecting the shape of the 1-9 happenings.
    it bulges around 6 (which is 2/3s of the way down, hanging like a gut...) where logic/grouping or iteration of a list has made indentation of blocks containing more code.
    a sub is like a block with a name it can be found by, lexical variables from within the block cease to exist outside that block. the curly section of an if ($some) { ... } statement is also a block. they build pyramids that nest together overlapping concepts and wiring vast stretches of reality into each other. the whole of a running stylehouse is hanging out of one block somewhere that has not yet returned. it finds ways to coil around and feel time.

    anyway the DNA (axioms ACGT) are carpentry of the spheres, the RNA zips around being exuded and rolled over the domes. RNA has axioms ACGU, U being the braid pattern, basically out and back, or a complex vector mapped into a simple out and back, or something playing out over time/space, hmm. watch Rick and Morty.
    Holy Motors SWEET. We can mash up Terry Gilliam's animation of the stick-like-mountain-top temple throwing scientists off the edge to try inventing flight.
    in Stan Tenen's video there's something about the T. upside down through. it's a distribution point, something to wrap curves out from. such are the poles we stand on to invent lambdas.

    anyway Natalie realises how Australia would have been a distant beautiful memory in her head rather than a constant taunt of a better bunch of stuff happening over there and not here. Such a shit thing is facebook. Wow. Needs a huge style magnet to suck everyone out.

    So yeah it is made of pages but their definition is the most variable thing, depth and composition is the key. can make a huge internet style happening with free git repo hosting.
    it will spin a mosaic of sound and light for miles and miles, art vortexing. it gets spawn through the vortex into a train of J. line and curve. smallest graspable chunk of change (at whatever level). a sentence. an incremental change.
    so the tape comes out as Js. they gets sent to elvi. they might be code to run, which might update html or whatever the stuff is we are streaming stimuli into.
    and then there's all these huge tapes of culture to go and play back.
    the tape is then an vortexed image of a wormhole life, a movie of the wormhole happening. wormholes also modulate into themselves like a freeze dried state for communicating, saving to disk.
    then the tapes can be shared with metadata, bringing them into the web.

    so all the subroutine calls all over are little Js as well. big spinny bush of synapse.

    so you can say, go here, what's this, watch this, find the pathway of its whole existence

    context richness.

    form.

    and then they build 1s as Codons (genetic model for something like a travel/ghost/wormhole coupling)
    where layers can be injected in space anywhere without breaking the fabric of it
    right now time is not something we can flop out anywhere, depending on what we're going for

     Stan Tenen (ST)
       "A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used."
       reciprocal spiral means its based on one over everything - ST
        not log/golden/archimedes spiral, too self-similar
       like Egyptian Fractions!
       "1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16 = 43/48"
       "The Egyptians had special symbols for 1/2, 2/3, and 3/4 that were used to reduce the size of numbers greater than 1/2 when such numbers were converted to an Egyptian fraction series."

      the [o is interesting

      this stuff may have changed recently (this [o stuff)
      or subtracted
      or it may be getting watched and filtered and triggerised and hit 3 million times per second
        such operations point through accum & deaccum

      like chains contain bunches of language that get fired sometimes and sometimes and sometimes
      the chain itself could start deciding how to move
      or the effect of such anyway
      given that the chain is a Way and w.G is a ghost maintaining the Way's squishinessby squishinesssquish,  kompressibility, mostly via K
      but also B[, and anything else important
      so basically to compress/serialise the way:
        K, e + difference of some kind of blank or stationary Way descriptor
        and the ...
        
        yeah the difference from a default K
        is the K+B{ ish identity of the Way, which can be saved into into some text field for storage
        such acompressedness would go well in a database situation
        esp if the esp if pg_perl still exists and can adapt queries to Ways
        yeah so Ways can fit into database schemas.
        or you could fit the database schema over rthe way.

    In some approaches the floorplan may be a partition of the whole chip area into axis aligned rectangles to be occupied by IC blocks. This partition is subject to various constraints and requirements of optimization: block area, aspect ratios, estimated total measure of interconnects, etc.

    I can build stuff to explain these number systems soon. his work is really inspiring because it conveys in riddles from a vortex of unknowable truth.

    the lambda function (upside down y) is the number one symbol of the vague cult of computer people that actually "know" about computers, it's been making the people that try go funny for ages.

    perhaps because of the number system being a crucial clue to the exuder of form once you get down to grains like lambdas, and the confusion around lambda is akin to not knowing about the base 10 system being these other two systems composited together.

    BUT that's if you want to go all the way down to there, someone will before long... But I can not look much more at that and save our NZ, which is the whole trick, what is meant by "spiral" most of the time, but that lambda madness will be more up for grabs from what I build.

    I have worked out lots more traction with genetics, if they got me MHActed again I could definitely get support from scientists. I just don't know how to get support now while I'm still a punter writing code that isn't enlightening people. that's the whole trick, getting there.

    so stylehouse is harmonising with Rodin's theories. it's good when things seem to want to grow more later but don't need to right now. it's good to have stuff lying around to expand peoples brains with too, it is a thought-as-vibrations-that-produce-harmony/space/sparks thing, language as evolving stock, belief as power, total cultivation.

    instead of pages and pages of someone's lingo, the dialectic involved here is more dynamic and hyperlinking, which can make a lot more interesting stuff happen in your brain while you have all these half understood things lying around like always.

    it's get some thinking going like that or spend forever living in insecticide world. they behave like insects because their computers don't hold their consciousness good enough and they end up serving them like poorly understood but unavoidable masters, of numbers over people, re life.

    this is the real state of the mind that I'm reaching for with stylehouse. anyway I'm gunna get in there or it's never going to get online and show people...
line drivers often have to be located as close to bonding pads as possible;
chip area is therefore in some cases given a minimum area in order to fit in the required number of pads;
areas are clustered in order to limit data paths thus frequently featuring defined structures such as cache RAM, multiplier, barrel shifter, line driver and arithmetic logic unit;
purchased intellectual property blocks (IP-blocks), such as a processor core, come in predefined area blocks;
some IP-blocks come with legal limitations such as permitting no routing of signals directly above the block.

    Tractors manage a wormhole

       by delegating levels to yonder Tractors down the O chain
    
    so it comes back to being a chain of ghosts with tractors in

    Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations such as scaling, reflection, and rotation; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, theoretic models, language, music and even knowledge itself.

    the creativity spiral needs a vortex

        while spinning you AROUND the coming IT, through time

  A Tractor is a floating bridge to an expected wormholiness
      
      "export" the way 'Arr' from to make Tw bridge to G tractor
      Tw is a T with wayish point/$ar
      the bridge is $A = A[$someid, $picture]
      $A is the horizontal inside
      in $G _lwp you can grab A/whatever
        and chain/hack on for case
    
     defining B_  is like a PK on the OGW (using retract)
       two B_ meeting from each line
       so we can find the same "thing" in a pair of wormholes
         with something to do together like percolate events from tips
    
    Tw is a jumble while easily chucking meaningful way into T awaits..
     tractors are arrived by sanity with those things
    
    Codons with traction have the W/tractor Ghost attached
     that is used for A[]
     when you have $A (tractor chain (Way))

      splat makes wormholes -> lines -> R -> B
      opening the line could mean anything
      so every step requires a haunt,
       L/splat-line finds a tractor for that $line to make a R
         L/splat-R finds a tractor for each B
           L/splat-B returns v
       so it finds a ghost
        to return a chain to make the style phase work
