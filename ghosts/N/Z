  codons:   |
      get some new Codons ffs!
      
      make em loud & crawly, catalog and live data
      dials and modes for the whole developing
       turn on more restarting on recode
      
      the electrodes that move around the snake
      like Elvis spawns from a twisted H

       ^ projections of the scaling between hemispheres as we build snakes
       
        an L rotating around the vertical
        things hanging from the horizontal
        moved around with magnets on fishing rods
        over each other
        light expands
        that L metaphor was sprouted for a mechanical sand scraper, forest style
        
        the pronouns
        so nojo means ways wholly replace
        we could see a promise on the traction of the merge
        or anything on the anything of anything
        nots are not pronouns
        nots are like knots
        the bit of language to serve
        ways is a w, little wave
        we read it as a knot
        depending on what force we want in return
        that relates to more, another y, something of n
        this write is realy knotty
        interpret it for the linear
        or break out and thump in the linear
        how linear can you keep going is a measure of use, maybe

      the pos/neg effect is for the spin
      so the convo convulses
      spirals sharing shapes
        
        the BEACH
        make that an overwhelming...
        waves of sticks washing in
        eels with thoughticles
        
        is the codon zipperator
        mashing watery stuff
        
        reminds me of looking for panel properties above panelthingy properties without any screen thats not panel

    Codo is for ghosting ghosts.

    context richness.

    form.

    and then they build 1s as Codons (genetic model for something like a travel/ghost/wormhole coupling)
    where layers can be injected in space anywhere without breaking the fabric of it
    right now time is not something we can flop out anywhere, depending on what we're going for
    take that morality

   wish the night was easier to manage
   to intuit potential forms in the creative flow
   and end up in beautifully orchestrated dream
   its all crucial to the next bit and the next bit
     or it can be a fractional nightmare

     just inside the wormhole was the task at hand
     deeper understanding of a swamp-like
     creature here
     
     gravity for places
     can be switched on and off like awareness
     to make sets of stuff fall out of space or along curves
     negative ions make dust rain
     etc.
     if this is a language compiler how fast can it die (how fast it learns evolution)
     saturation of nothingnoise is the killer

        # it's an unfoldment

        #  - we build this up in W
        #  - flows to another M for bamboo

        # the latter two need deleting

        # that corner where things multiply without much meaning should go away somewhere
        # the importance of lambdas is compositing steps into a vortex
        # it doesn't need to talk like Rodin
        
        # eg. TafuBl is a little braid, like a 
        # grab a copy, mod it, feed into braid is all
        
     
     trees and shit

     of the q factor
     this language thing Im doing suffers from lack of style
     and all that extra geometry it could have
     envelopes consciousness
     the stem is a tangent
     which is like the hammerhead O
     the dialectic becomes too convoluted and distorts its surroundings
     trailing off the quality of meaning until youre working backwards
     
      "Im not saying absolute truth when I say 'is', I'm just trying to fit things in to a short time period."
     Stan Tenen (ST)
       "A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used."
       reciprocal spiral means its based on one over everything - ST
        not log/golden/archimedes spiral, too self-similar
       like Egyptian Fractions!
       "1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16 = 43/48"
       "The Egyptians had special symbols for 1/2, 2/3, and 3/4 that were used to reduce the size of numbers greater than 1/2 when such numbers were converted to an Egyptian fraction series."
       when I make gestures and my ego isnt there the gestures are from god
     
     easy and hard, related unrelated, helpful useless
     depending on getting back within the q
     graphed as whole blob + snap
     should it be a snap?
     where you rampage a new idea through to it
     might lose the brain swamp or make its fractal embed better
     grab gizmos from the side
     cell city
     
     the thing is squeezing through a q factor
     expression
     
     Ds:
       0=0.5 is like ^>
       0.5-1 is like v>
       
       that half a bit is beating in another dimension
       where you nest waves, Y snaps these
       which is just another place to figure out what to do
       
       ie through some travel at 0.5
       ie Y
       where you fly over the progress of the A junket
       like an arm pit for junk
       junket
       
       when you cant find the background
       to change the most important stuff about the XFCE toolbar
       is like the delusory media
       
       do thebusiness from T
       Ds will be spin one day
       T._hair can long wave
       does recursion at 0.5 for now
       but it could just happen
       braid will foam T
      # this iteration    will be behind synaptic field shift
      # top level stuff - its unification is the D above this
      # that is the two layers of interaction going on right now
      # most of the territory is known
      # its just detail
      # off the same arc

        # meaning competition
        # the process for creating the above line of code
        # needs to be like 'u S id' typed
        # some thing implied by space
        # some mystery chased
        # where/how is important nature
        # things get grabbed by typing and clicking
        # those patterns are truth to style from
        # then style collapses in
        # it comes out another G
        # why not
        # they might be nearby visually
        # pulled out of the unified field 
        # so style vortex creates code
        
        # think about styles
        #
        #       lots     of     fast     EXPR    business
        #
        #   various ways to involve Cs
        #    equations to observe
        # one of those points in time again
        # with all the stuff
        # alighted by only how we got there
         and then in a net process we gather progress
         to be synapses
         and string together meaning from a flow of impressions, logic
         to flick/snap language across to another angle
        # logic EXPR style EXPR css...
        #       
        #   whole braid state should be straight forward
        #   bendy stuff would work too
        #   just need to create time in the braid
        #   which is the separation of 0 and 1
        #
        #   how it treats time, also
        #   state could be a game
        #   travel could be rhythmic
        #   
        #   like painting a family vs painting like drums
        
        #   T._trail.i is some A
        #   it leads to the whole braid
        #  
        # EXPR branches these trails of inquiry logically and however
        # all along the allele tower
        # lets logic flow around satellites
        # 
        # sifts entropy through meshes of different dimensions
        # a tour of satellites
        #   look
        # then see more in u.Li.o or so
        
        # and all that remains at the ends is... yeah
        # querying _trail for a path is the A buzz
        # useful for attaching stuff without whole mess around
        # pathways of EXPR could stretch out through dimensions
        # and time... things may be moving around that know about time

        the heart of the world is pumping way hard
        too much motion of the same ways
     
     balance - not too cheesy but not extremely obscure "something like that"
      potentially shared traction through redis
      sneaky advanced cache making possible
      really good tests would indicate such peaks in the C layers
      layers of intuition about flows of view and intention to view

      - G=ux within G=ux - u is allele tower
      - G+=ux spawn ux, G=ux that ux, ...
      
      - compile G/0 G.U.subs into G subs
        compile G hooks etc into G::ux subs etc
        compile = braid from way
         the new hooks is Ds
           they look like

                 etc();
                 etc();
           or just like hooks under subs
           they spawn F, sig die should handle all the uglies

         braid is a sub thats been divided up in to Egyptian Fractions
         mix and match happening with other braids
         put together in order
         through random pm file loaded to define subs into G or G::some
         
         
         then G->w just looks up the $G->$subname for the given arguments
             args could complicate the braid somewhere
            which is where the same way has harmonics of complexity
            ad hoc complication
            ways to inject hooks along the braid
            how do those ways figure where they are and what to do?

   a sequence of Codon lines:  'ෙ ෙ ෙ'
   moving and applying styles vs having them in a tube already... 'dolphin bubble rings'

   these pods are in the diagonal grid formation
   which can hold spirals of base9 addition
     travel in pixels of 1, 9x9, 16x16.
     
     the Ds is this line that doesnt curve now
     but _braid and _trail and last.ux show curvey
     
     so the spiral can go out many layers... or in?
     
     the purpose of scientific method is to select from among a multitude of hypothesis
     spiraling vortex arty vagueness obviously helps hugely with over-the-edge stuff

          what L.o means already, more from grappling        varieties
        
        we can inject meanwhile into Ds, fractionating complexity
        this could make list processing that eases dimensional judderbar hops

        language stretching across it, turning high level bits on and off

        so things can hook themselves in from synaptic ingredients like braid, ux
        
        it calls braid to run a given Ds
        iterates Ds->[Di
        it iterates Ds, sets 
        anTop does current D, which travels
        Y moves L out from the braidu
        wordu means the unified end of word
        
      -    # the ux's Ds involved can invoke another braid
      -    #   or another anTop
      -    # to run different dimensions from a centrifuge with a fractal shape bleeding from T
      -    # like the root of $T is now, _braid, _trail, everything running around is deeper
      -    # the other end of $T is the unified field
      -    
      -    # args to anTop may change i from inside the braid for recursion
      -    # or Dw if top
      -    # T._braid._no_circles catches recursion via _trail.i
      -    # and yeah... we are in already and return to from anTop the top of the braid

      the [o is interesting

      this stuff may have changed recently (this [o stuff)
      or subtracted
      or it may be getting watched and filtered and triggerised and hit 3 million times per second
        such operations point through accum & deaccum

      like chains contain bunches of language that get fired sometimes and sometimes and sometimes
      the chain itself could start deciding how to move
      or the effect of such anyway
      given that the chain is a Way and w.G is a ghost maintaining the Way's squishinessby squishinesssquish,  kompressibility, mostly via K
      but also B[, and anything else important
      so basically to compress/serialise the way:
        K, e + difference of some kind of blank or stationary Way descriptor
        and the ...
        
        yeah the difference from a default K
        is the K+B{ ish identity of the Way, which can be saved into into some text field for storage
        such acompressedness would go well in a database situation
        esp if the esp if pg_perl still exists and can adapt queries to Ways
        yeah so Ways can fit into database schemas.
        or you could fit the database schema over rthe way.

    In some approaches the floorplan may be a partition of the whole chip area into axis aligned rectangles to be occupied by IC blocks. This partition is subject to various constraints and requirements of optimization: block area, aspect ratios, estimated total measure of interconnects, etc.
    
    axis aligned rect:
      drawing u state changes axis
    block area:
      of language ramshacklingness
    aspect ratios:

    chips are 2d. another u is 3d.
    (often using wire bonding) are normally located at the circumference of the chip;

    I can build stuff to explain these number systems soon. his work is really inspiring because it conveys in riddles from a vortex of unknowable truth.

    the lambda function (upside down y) is the number one symbol of the vague cult of computer people that actually "know" about computers, it's been making the people that try go funny for ages.

    perhaps because of the number system being a crucial clue to the exuder of form once you get down to grains like lambdas, and the confusion around lambda is akin to not knowing about the base 10 system being these other two systems composited together.

    BUT that's if you want to go all the way down to there, someone will before long... But I can not look much more at that and save our NZ, which is the whole trick, what is meant by "spiral" most of the time, but that lambda madness will be more up for grabs from what I build.

    I have worked out lots more traction with genetics, if they got me MHActed again I could definitely get support from scientists. I just don't know how to get support now while I'm still a punter writing code that isn't enlightening people. that's the whole trick, getting there.

    so stylehouse is harmonising with Rodin's theories. it's good when things seem to want to grow more later but don't need to right now. it's good to have stuff lying around to expand peoples brains with too, it is a thought-as-vibrations-that-produce-harmony/space/sparks thing, language as evolving stock, belief as power, total cultivation.

    instead of pages and pages of someone's lingo, the dialectic involved here is more dynamic and hyperlinking, which can make a lot more interesting stuff happen in your brain while you have all these half understood things lying around like always.

    it's get some thinking going like that or spend forever living in insecticide world. they behave like insects because their computers don't hold their consciousness good enough and they end up serving them like poorly understood but unavoidable masters, of numbers over people, re life.

    this is the real state of the mind that I'm reaching for with stylehouse. anyway I'm gunna get in there or it's never going to get online and show people...
line drivers often have to be located as close to bonding pads as possible;
chip area is therefore in some cases given a minimum area in order to fit in the required number of pads;
areas are clustered in order to limit data paths thus frequently featuring defined structures such as cache RAM, multiplier, barrel shifter, line driver and arithmetic logic unit;
purchased intellectual property blocks (IP-blocks), such as a processor core, come in predefined area blocks;
some IP-blocks come with legal limitations such as permitting no routing of signals directly above the block.

    chains takeover sections of the wormhole

      *-* linkage that feeds the crawl of T()
    
    Tractors manage a wormhole
      providing namespace
       by delegating levels to yonder Tractors down the O chain
    
    so it comes back to being a chain of ghosts with tractors in
       then that chain can be thrashed however
       and manipulate the matrix of things it pretends to be
    
    a way can become a promise
    so singular events

    Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations such as scaling, reflection, and rotation; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, theoretic models, language, music and even knowledge itself.

    and then each of those atomic particle s will look like things, but whatever from atoms... (its a different codon)
     - modern science just wanted to be uncaught by the common man, to fit into the mythology of the time
     but it all can be.

    the creativity spiral needs a vortex
        to pull in the things it means
        while spinning you AROUND the coming IT, through time
        and not out in to space,

         to just get it working

  A Tractor is a floating bridge to an expected wormholiness
      
      "export" the way 'Arr' from to make Tw bridge to G tractor
      Tw is a T with wayish point/$ar
      the bridge is $A = A[$someid, $picture]
      $A is the horizontal inside
      in $G _lwp you can grab A/whatever
        and chain/hack on for case
    
     defining B_  is like a PK on the OGW (using retract)
       two B_ meeting from each line
       so we can find the same "thing" in a pair of wormholes
         with something to do together like percolate events from tips
    
    Tw is a jumble while easily chucking meaningful way into T awaits..
     tractors are arrived by sanity with those things
    
    Codons with traction have the W/tractor Ghost attached
     that is used for A[]
     when you have $A (tractor chain (Way))
     
     the field in front of any point is a race for language

      splat makes wormholes -> lines -> R -> B
      opening the line could mean anything
      so every step requires a haunt,
       L/splat-line finds a tractor for that $line to make a R
         L/splat-R finds a tractor for each B
           L/splat-B returns v
       so it finds a ghost
        to return a chain to make the style phase work
