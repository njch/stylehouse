=head1 DISCUSSION

Build the interweb-debris-ray systematic all the way into the cpu
and through into other bits of time. Try to grasp some new reality,
its former, it possibilities and hosting processes in one big
nested wall of music with as much art to it as possible.

Ghost (universal) Travel (joints) Wormhole (space+) pour into one.
It's an entropy motor, abdomin/tractor of all parts, one-many.

Shows dialectic manifold for things genesising ito space, lingo,
the pure maths should slide easily over/into the four.

Show where tons and tons of little jobs are, since these big inert of
the language's alwayses are presenting this indifferent medium where
new culture can have much self expression to little tangle.

We always build the 4d housing and C (tycsc, the bit) schematics over
and over. Brains do names and fractions, everything needs overthrowing,
or synaptic overloading, T is most that. Instrument spaces.

See http://njch.github.io/ somewhere low M space for the intro.

Also not, N/Z

=head2 ENTROPY DECREASES

For doming in/creasing to 
Without becoming too much of a system for consuming other systems.

The cross of matter should work.

=head2 DEPENDENCIES


    sudo apt-get install sshfs libyaml-syck-perl libscriptalicious-perl libjson-xs-perl libfile-slurp-perl libtext-vimcolor-perl libuuid-perl libyaml-syck-perl liblist-moreutils-perl

To put the b (walky talkie, listen/notify networking) on the end of commands, have Mojo::Pg and a database named 's'. g/c/81/UpPg

    sudo dpkg -i sea/libmojo-pg-perl_1.02-1_all.deb

The non-b synapse is rusty, see t/Slt/Follower/6 and around for background
on filesystem... unities should flow on any kind of space, given the set of
lego available. Use Wob for non-b Web?

and /etc/hosts alias for s -> you, or:

    ln -s you:10094 listen

then you can: 

    perl got Web 4 b

serves public/lowcal.html, tape plays if request path = '/'.
Websockets you for-web-tape action via the listen/notify 'Js', see SevWo.
Also writes life/W/$thing tape.

See the tape.

    perl got Goh 4 b     # perc ghost change
    perl got Goat 4 b    # watch ghost change

Tandem ghost percolation. Wakes up J (mo or pi) by pin.

    perl got Be 4 b      # repl/fork/wander

in ^ enter ' JJ' to run JJ, which should appear on screen...
edit g/c/99/JJ to adjust which isle it's looking at...
just more of that.

To manually Goat (way from g/... to w/way/...) enter 'S' ^
Only load way once unless zapped in on Pin (82)

See 'c/48 Zb' for a non-JJ T initiator if you fall out of your working.

Git stuff. Spread out space, lab edge, fall together the Raft. Show workings.
See how Stable catches up to Black when stable, cv switches/pans between such.
Work has to be included in some kind of unity somewhere, a vector doing:
    u Thing
casually includes thing. A coder traveling trees of code does
    n Thing
And collects all the codes at the w/$isle/Self (up to some Top), which
something might find. u puts in the mind, n puts down on the ground,
the rest of that ground process may lead to it becoming some W thing
the u would use through name resolution. The ground needs tractor for
flinging entropy, reproducing/mapping life.

They are the same but for the shape of the pipe, using a name system.

So aft 'perl got' things mean G.t (main pin) G.cv (fraction) then G.c.$k,
see g/c/5/Run

usu. t cv c sc  isa  cross of matter, everything emerges in

=head1 DELIVERABLES

Physical internet.

Two tests, Chl and Elt, run like:
    perl got Chl 4 b

etc.

=head1 MISSING PARTS

Is intended to create a lot of visible missing parts, with a vague webbing of hope,
a stairway to evolution and its tools.
