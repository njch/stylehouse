Long way going to
Get my medicine
Sky's the autumn grey of a lonely wren

Piano from a window played
Gone tomorrow, gone yesterday

I found it in the street
At first I did not see
Lying at my feet
A trampled rose

Passing the hat in church
It never stops going round

You never pay just once
To get the job done

What I done to me,
I done to you
So what happened to the trampled rose?

In the muddy street
With the fireworks and leaves

A blind man with a cup I asked
Would he sing 'Kisses Sweeter Than Wine'

I know this rose,
Like I know my name
The one I gave my love,
It was the same
Now I find it in the street,
A trampled rose
